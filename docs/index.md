# Welcome to Indy Center

Welcome to the documentation site for the Indy Center Tech Team.

## üöÄ Our k3s Cluster

We run our applications on a **[k3s](https://k3s.io)** cluster orchestrated with **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)**.

Our cluster consists of 4 nodes, each named after pioneering women in aviation and computer science:

- **Beverly (Worker Node):** Named after [Beverly Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley_Bass), the first female captain at American Airlines and one of the pilots who landed in Gander during 9/11, as portrayed in "Come From Away"

- **Theresa (Worker Node):** Named after Captain [Theresa Claiborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_Claiborne), the first Black woman pilot in the Air Force and a trailblazing United Airlines captain with over 23,000 flight hours

- **Hopper (Ops Node):** Named after [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper), a pioneer in computer programming who developed the first compiler and coined the term "debugging" - she was also a U.S. Navy rear admiral.

- **Lovelace (Control Plane Node):** Named after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), the world's first computer programmer who wrote the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer.
