# Facility Directives Committee

This document outlines the responsibilities, decision-making processes, and collaboration workflow between the **Facility Directives Committee (FDC)** and the **Tech Team for Indy Center**.

## Decision Making Authority

This section outlines which team has the decision making authority for various changes and improvements.

### FDC Approval Required

The following changes require an approval from the FDC:

-   New features or tools that affect operational policies or procedures
-   Major UI/UX overhauls impacting controller interactions
-   Changes that alter the scope or intent of FDC-owned directives

### Tech Team Autonomy

The following changes are given to the Tech Team and do not require approval from the FDC:

-   Bug fixes that do not significantly alter platform functionality or intent
-   Backend optimizations, infrastructure maintenance, and database improvements
-   Minor UI updates that do not affect FDC policies (e.g., layout tweaks, visual improvements, mobile enhancements)
-   Minor features not driven by FDC (e.g., search functionality or other tooling improvements)

## Collaboration Process

This section explains how we resolve disputes and collaborate.

### Dispute Resolution

If there is a disagreement between the FDC and Tech Team, the leads of both teams will discuss and attempt a resolution. If no resolution is reached, the Facility Staff (ATM or DATM) will make the final decision.

### Feature Requests

The FDC will submit new feature requests either on Discord or through the appropriate GitHub issue page.

### Feature Review

The Tech Team will review and prioritize requests, with high-priority items (e.g., urgent policy updates) expedited in agreement with the FDC. The Tech Team will prioritize bug fixes based on severity and impact and notify the FDC of critical issues.

## Deployment and Releases

This outlines the review and deployment process.

### Review Process

All new features and significant changes will be deployed to the testing environment where FDC can review them. Beta testing is encouraged for new features in this environment. Approvals can be discussed informally via Discord between the FDC and Tech Team.

### Deployment Process

Deployments can occur at any time but must align with FDC approval requirements. Features requiring FDC approval will not be deployed to production until approval is granted.

### Communication

The Tech Team will communicate release details, including maintenance windows or downtime, if applicable. Every effort will be made to minimize downtime during deployments.

### Rollbacks

If a deployment negatively affects operations, the Tech Team will roll back the changes and notify the appropriate teams.

## Agreement Changes

This agreement can be reviewed and updated at any time. A log of decision updates will be maintained below.
